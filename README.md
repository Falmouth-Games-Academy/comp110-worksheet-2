# COMP110 Worksheet 3: Flowcharts and pseudocode

This is the base repository for COMP110 Worksheet 3.

Fork this repository, and edit `README.md` to show your pseudocode solving the worksheet task. Tip: use triple backticks to preserve spacing, e.g.:

```
Array.randomWords = ["mouse", "house", "spouse"]
x = Array.randomWords[0]

\\This code means that the statement x is now equal to "mouse" the first word in the array//

import time

print("welcome to the game")
time.sleep(3)

\\time.sleep is syntax that will pause the execution for a few seconds. This gives the game a good flow.//

userInput "choose a random 5 letter word"

if userInput = x:
	then print("congratulations, you did it")
elif userInput != x:
	then print("Wow! you failed, try again)
	RETURN TO START
else:{
string.count(x, start = "o", end = "e")
while userInput = string.count:
	print("You were close, try some of these letters again") RETURN TO START}

if userInput != x = 4times
	print("that's 4 guesses. Game Over")
	RETURN TO START

\\playing the fallout guessing game using conditionals. "string.count" counts specified characters which allows me to tell the player
that they were close to the answer if they used any similar letters//
