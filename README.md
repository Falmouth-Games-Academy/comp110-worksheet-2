Fork this repository, and edit `README.md` to show your pseudocode solving the worksheet task. Tip: use triple backticks to preserve spacing, e.g.:

```
guesses = 3
running = True
word = null

list = all words
guessed_word = first word in list

WHILE True:
   
   IF word IS correct:
      WIN
      
   ELSE IF guesses >= 1:
      
```
