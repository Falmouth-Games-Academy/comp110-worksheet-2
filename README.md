This is the base repository for COMP110 Worksheet 3.

Fork this repository, and edit `README.md` to show your pseudocode solving the worksheet task. Tip: use triple backticks to preserve spacing, e.g.:

```
Start

working_list = (list of all avalible answers)
matching_characters = 0
unsolved = True


while unsolved
    answer = userinput("choose a random word from the working list")
    if you've won celerbrate
	unsolved = False

    else
	similarity = number characters of answer that match actual answer 
        for n in range length(working_list)
	    matching_characters = number of matching characters between awnser and working word
	    if matching_characters == similarity 
		do nothing

	    else
		working_list remove working_list[n]
	remove answer from working_list


End
